just in case nothing is working for you: 

http://35.196.238.64/SEproject 

This is the live version of our project. We will be keeping it up in case install fails.

To install, start apache and open (your host name)/SEproject/install/install.php in a browser.

It will ask for your current mysql information. 

NOTE: Due to time constraints (and lack of knowledge on a clean solution),
the password for root needs to be changed to cs3773 in order for everything to function.
However, for the initial setup, your current password is fine.
I am sorry for the inconvenience this may cause.

There will be only one user on first start. Use the employee login under
admin (password is also admin) to create accounts.
